# Web Scrapping

## Requests-HTML
This library intends to make parsing HTML (e.g. scraping the web) as simple and intuitive as possible.

When using this library you automatically get:
    - Full JavaScript support!
    - CSS Selectors (a.k.a jQuery-style, thanks to PyQuery).
    - XPath Selectors, for the faint of heart.
    - Mocked user-agent (like a real web browser).
    - Automatic following of redirects.
    - Connectionâ€“pooling and cookie persistence.
    - The Requests experience you know and love, with magical parsing abilities.
    - Async Support

  ### Installation
  ```
  pipenv install requests-html
  ```
